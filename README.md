# Gnosis EPL Grammar

## Installing Dependencies

### Using pipenv
Run `$ pipenv shell` to create a python virtualenv and load the .env into the environment variables in the shell.

Then run: `$ pipenv install` to install all packages, or `$ pipenv install -d` to also install the packages that help during development, eg: ipython.
This runs the installation using **pip** under the hood, but also handle the cross dependency issues between packages and checks the packages MD5s for security mesure.


### Using pip
To install using pip directly, one needs to use the `--extra-index-url` when running the `pip install` command, in order for to be able to use our private Pypi repository.

To install from the `requirements.txt` file, run the following command:
```
$ pip install --extra-index-url https://${SIT_PYPI_USER}:${SIT_PYPI_PASS}@sit-pypi.herokuapp.com/simple -r requirements.txt
```
